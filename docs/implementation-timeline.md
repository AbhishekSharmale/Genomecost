## Contingency Plans

### If Behind Schedule
1. **Reduce Scope**: Focus on core cost tracking features
2. **Simplify UI**: Use pre-built templates instead of custom design
3. **Mock Integrations**: Use simulated data for complex integrations

### If Technical Blockers
1. **Azure API Issues**: Implement comprehensive mocking layer
2. **Performance Problems**: Optimize database queries and add caching
3. **Integration Failures**: Provide manual data import options

### If Resource Constraints
1. **Extend Timeline**: Add 2-week buffer for critical features
2. **Outsource**: Contract specific components (e.g., UI design)
3. **Community**: Leverage open-source solutions where possible
